title: Callouts & Admonitions
description: Callout blocks or admonitions, like "notes" or "hints" are outlined or shaded areas of a document to bring attention to particular information.

Callouts, or "admonitions", highlight a particular block of text that exists slightly apart from the narrative of your page, such as a note or a warning.
For example, try changing the following example of a `{tip}` admonition to a `{warning}`:

```{myst}
:::{tip}
Try changing `tip` to `warning`!
:::
```

In MyST we call these kind of directives {myst:directive}`admonitions <admonition>`, however, they are almost always used through their _named_ directives, like {myst:directive}`note` or {myst:directive}`danger`. Admonitions can be styled as `simple` or as a `dropdown`, and can optionally hide the icon using the {myst:directive}`admonition.class` option. There are ten kinds[^docutils-admonitions] of admonitions available:

```{list-table} Named admonitions that can be used as directives
:label: admonitions-list
* - ðŸ”µ {myst:directive}`note`
  - ðŸŸ  {myst:directive}`attention`
* - ðŸ”µ {myst:directive}`important`
  - ðŸŸ  {myst:directive}`caution`
* - ðŸŸ¢ {myst:directive}`hint`
  - ðŸŸ  {myst:directive}`warning`
* - ðŸŸ¢ {myst:directive}`seealso`
  - ðŸ”´ {myst:directive}`danger`
* - ðŸŸ¢ {myst:directive}`tip`
  - ðŸ”´ {myst:directive}`error`
```

[^docutils-admonitions]: These admonitions are the same as those used in [docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#specific-admonitions) and Sphinx.

See below for a demo of each admonition in the default theme.

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Note
```{note}
This is an note admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Important
```{important}
This is an important admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Hint
```{hint}
This is an hint admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} See Also
```{seealso}
This is an seealso admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Tip
```{tip}
This is an tip admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Attention
```{attention}
This is an attention admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Caution
```{caution}
This is an caution admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Warning
```{warning}
This is an warning admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Danger
```{danger}
This is an danger admonition
```
````

````{tab-item} Error
```{error}
This is an error admonition
```
````

`````

## Admonition Titles

All admonitions have a single argument ({myst:directive}`docs <admonition.arg>`), which is the admonition title and can use markdown.
If a title argument is not supplied the first node of the {myst:directive}`admonition.body` is used if it is a `heading` or a paragraph with fully bold text; otherwise the name of the directive is used (e.g. `seealso` becomes `See Also`; `note` becomes `Note`).

```{myst}
:::{tip} Admonition _title_
Here is an admonition!
:::
```

(admonition-github-compatibility)=
:::::::{tip} Compatibility with GitHub
:class: dropdown
GitHub markdown transforms blockquotes that start with a bold `Note` or text with `[!NOTE]` into a simple admonition (see [GitHub](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/16925)). This syntax only works for `note`, `important` or `warning`. MyST transforms these blockquotes into the appropriate admonitions with a `simple` {myst:directive}`admonition.class`.

```{myst}
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> **Note**
> This is a note

> **Warning**
> This is a warning
```

::::{tip} Compatibility with Pandoc & Quarto
:class: dropdown
In Quarto/Pandoc markdown admonitions are styled with special classes like `{.callout-note}` or `{.callout-tip}`).
If you are using Jupyter Book V1 or Sphinx documentation, use an {myst:directive}`admonition` directive with the specific class, for example:

```{myst}
::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Caption
This is an example of a callout with a caption.
:::
```

::::

::::{warning} Compatibility with Sphinx
:class: dropdown
In Sphinx, all named admonitions (e.g. `{note}` or `{tip}`), have **no arguments**.
If you place content on the first line it will instead be prepended to the admonition body.
If you are using Jupyter Book V1 or Sphinx documentation, use an {myst:directive}`admonition` directive with the specific class, for example:

```{myst}
:::{admonition} The Title
:class: hint
This is the body.
:::
```

(admonition-dropdown)=

## Admonition Dropdown

To turn an admonition into a dropdown, add the `dropdown` {myst:directive}`admonition.class` to them.
Dropdown admonitions use the `<details>` HTML element (meaning they also will work without Javascript!),
and they can be helpful when including text that shouldn't immediately visible to your readers.
To have a dropdown-style admonition start open, add the {myst:directive}`admonition.open` option.

```{myst}
:::{note} Click Me! ðŸ‘ˆ
:class: dropdown
ðŸ‘‹ This could be a solution to a problem or contain other detailed explanations.
:::
```

:::{seealso} You can also use a `{dropdown}`
:class: dropdown
You can also use a {myst:directive}`dropdown` directive, which provides a more compact writing experience and is simpler in the displayed style. See [](#dropdowns) for more information.
