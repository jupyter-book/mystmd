## Developer guide

Technical detail about project architecture and contributing code is given in the [developer guide](./developer.md) 

## Our team compass

The [Jupyter Book Team Compass][compass] is a source of truth for our team structure and policy.
It also has a lot of information about how to contribute.

## Code of conduct

We expect all contributors to this project to [Code of Conduct][coc].

## Where we work

We do most of our work in GitHub repositories in [the `jupyter-book/` GitHub organization](https://github.com/jupyter-book).

## Where we communicate

- For chat and real-time conversations: [The MyST community Discord server](https://discord.mystmd.org).
- For discussions around work and development: Issues in the `mystmd` repositories.
- For general discussions and questions: [the `mystmd` community forum](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/discussions).

## Relevant GitHub repositories

The `mystmd` project covers a _subset_ of the [`jupyter-book/` GitHub organization](https://github.com/jupyter-book).
It focuses on the Javascript-based MyST Markdown engine and ecosystem, as well as the markdown syntax that MyST uses.

Below is a list of relevant repositories and a brief description of each.

- [mystmd](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd): The MyST document engine and functionality not related to specific renderers.
- [myst-theme](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme): The web components and themes that are used for either the book or article themes for MyST.
- [myst-spec](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-spec): Questions about the markdown syntax for MyST and standardization efforts for MyST functionality.
- [jupyterlab-myst](https://github.com/jupyter-book/jupyterlab-myst): Questions about the JupyterLab extension for MyST.
- [MyST Templates](https://github.com/myst-templates): Repositories that contain templates for rendering MyST documents into various outputs like LaTeX, JATS, Typst, and Docx.

> [!NOTE]
> There are many repositories with similar functionality in the `executablebooks/` organization. Many of these are based around the [Sphinx documentation ecosystem](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). For example, the [MyST-NB repository](https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-nb) is a Sphinx extension for Jupyter notebooks, and the [MyST Parser repository](https://github.com/executablebooks/myst-parser) is a MyST markdown parser for Sphinx.

## Contribution workflow

Generally speaking, our contribution workflow looks something like this:

- **Conduct free-form conversation and brainstorming in our forum**. We have [a community forum](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/discussions) for general discussion that does not necessarily require a change to our code or documentation. If you have a specific enhancement or bug you would like to propose for resolution, see the next steps.
- **Search open issues to see if your idea is already discussed**. Use [a GitHub search in the `jupyter-book/` organization](https://github.com/search?q=org:jupyter-book%20&type=code) to see if you should add to an existing issue or create a new one. If you don't think an issue exists that covers your idea or bug, go ahead and open one.
- **Discuss and propose changes in issues**. Issues are a way for us to agree on a problem to solve, and align on a way to solve it. They should invite broad feedback and be as explicit as possible when making formal proposals.
- **Make a pull request to implement an idea**. We use Pull Requests to formally propose changes to our code or documentation. These generally point to an issue and ideally will close it.
- **Iterate on the pull request and merge**. Pull Requests should have discussion and feedback from at least one core team member, and ideally from many. Once the PR is ready to merge, a core team member may decide to do so. See [our decision-making guide for formal details][governance].

This describes the high-level process that is usually followed.
In practice, we recommend attempting a contribution to get a feel for how it works in practice.

## How our team is structured

Our [Team page][team] lists all of the teams in the `jupyter-book/` organization and their members.
In addition, [our Governance page][governance] describes the responsibilities and authority that team members have.
