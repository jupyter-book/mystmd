title: MyST Markdown Tools
description: MyST (Markedly Structured Text) is designed to create publication-quality documents written entirely in Markdown.
---

{abbr}`MyST (Markedly Structured Text)` is an [ecosystem of open-source, community-driven tools](./overview.md) designed to revolutionize scientific communication. Our powerful authoring framework supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, reports and journals articles.

## Cool MyST Features 🪄

We think {abbr}`MyST (Markedly Structured Text)` is really cool, some of the features that we think stand out are highlighted below with links to places in the documentation where you can reproduce them!

---

🪄🐰 **Rabbit-hole links** allow you to get information to your reader as fast as possible, and they can deep-dive all the way to computations, code and interactive figures. You can play with this demo yourself in [](./quickstart-myst-markdown.md).

:::

🪄📊 **Live graphs** can be embedded directly in your documentation or articles with computation backed by Jupyter or JupyterLite – running locally, on Binder, or directly in your browser. Get up and running with Thebe in [](./integrating-jupyter.md)

:::{figure} ./videos/thebe.mp4

:::

🪄🪐 **JupyterLab support** for MyST comes with inline computations, support for `ipywidgets`, matplotlib sparklines, editable task-lists, rich frontmatter, and beautiful typography and other elements like dropdowns, grids and cards. Install [`jupyterlab-myst`](./quickstart-jupyter-lab-myst.md) today!

🪄📜 **Export to PDF** is easy with MyST, and we support hundreds of different journals out of the box, see [myst-templates](https://github.com/myst-templates)! You can also export to Microsoft Word or even JATS, which is used in scientific publishing. See the [](./quickstart-myst-documents.md)!

# Coming from Jupyter Book V1 or Sphinx?

👋 We are glad you are here! 💚

There are many ways that `mystmd` can be used with Jupyter Book and Sphinx. We recommend that you read [a high-level overview of MyST](./overview.md) as well as [the project background](./background.md), which goes over how these projects overlap and work together!

TL;DR
: **Yes**, you can use `mystmd` with your Jupyter Book! `mystmd` can create [scientific PDFs](./creating-pdf-documents.md) and can natively read the [`_toc.yml`](./table-of-contents.md) as well as all of your existing MyST Markdown content and [Jupyter Notebooks](./interactive-notebooks.ipynb).
: **Yes**, `mystmd` is compatible with [intersphinx](#intersphinx) even though it is written in JavaScript not Python!
: Jupyter Book and `mystmd` have **overlap** in the ability to create online books like this one. `mystmd` has some extra capabilities for [cross-references](./cross-references.md), interactivity and [performance](./accessibility-and-performance.md).
:::

## Cite `mystmd`

To cite or read more references about the `mystmd` project and related tools, see [](./cite.md).

## Project Goals

MyST is part of the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) organization, and is an open-source, community-driven project to improve scientific communication, including integrations into Jupyter Notebooks and computational results.

**Technical Goals**

- `mystmd` is a JavaScript parser and command line tool for working with MyST Markdown
- Parse MyST into a standardized [AST](wiki:Abstract_Syntax_Tree), that follows [the MyST Spec](https://mystmd.org/spec)
- Translate and render MyST into:
  - Modern [interactive websites](./quickstart-myst-documents.md), using React (like this website!)
  - PDFs and $\LaTeX$ documents, with [specific templates for over 400 journals](./creating-pdf-documents.md)
  - Microsoft Word [export](./creating-word-documents.md)
- Provide functionality for [cross-referencing](./cross-references.md), [external structured links](./external-references.md), and [scientific citations](./citations.md)

**Architecture**

The `mystmd` command line tool can be used to parse MyST Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks into an AST. This data can be saved as JSON, or rendered to a website (like this one!) or any number of formats including [PDF & $\LaTeX$](./creating-pdf-documents.md), [Word](./creating-word-documents.md), [React](./quickstart-myst-documents.md), or [JATS](./creating-jats-xml.md).

**Using Sphinx or Python?**

For integration with **Sphinx**, use the Python implementation for MyST or Jupyter Book, which can be found at:

- [MyST Python Parser for Sphinx](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)

Although many tools in the [MyST Ecosystem](https://mystmd.org) follow the same conventions and [specification](https://mystmd.org/spec), the following documentation refers only to the **JavaScript** MyST Markdown CLI.
