title: Website Themes & Templates
description: There are two templates for MyST websites, a `book-theme`, based loosely on Jupyter Book, and an `article-theme` that is designed for scientific documents with supporting notebooks.
---

Web templates allow MyST to render documents as HTML-based sites.
These provide different reading experiences that are designed for different types of MyST documents.
They are defined via the same templating system used for [static document exporting](./documents-exports.md), and a base set of web themes can be found in the [`jupyter-book/myst-theme` repository](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/tree/main/themes).

## Themes bundled with MyST

There are two templates for MyST websites, a `book-theme`, which is the default and is based loosely on Jupyter Book and an `article-theme` that is designed for scientific documents with supporting notebooks. The documentation for this site uses the `book-theme`. For a demonstration of the `article-theme`, you can see [an article on finite volume](https://simpeg.xyz/tle-finitevolume).

### Article Theme

The article theme is centered around a single document with supporting content, which is how many scientific articles are structured today: a narrative article with associated computational notebooks to reproduce a figure, document data-cleaning steps, or provide interactive visualization. These are listed as "supporting documents" in this theme and can be pulled in as normal with your [](./table-of-contents.md). For information on how to import your figures into your article, see [](./reuse-jupyter-outputs.md).

The frontmatter that is displayed at the top of the article is the contents of your project, including a project [thumbnail and banner](#thumbnail-and-banner). The affiliations for your authors, their ORCID, email, etc. are available by clicking directly on the author name.

## Change Site Templates

To manually specify your website template, use the `site.template` property:

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
:emphasize-lines: 4
:caption: Change the `template` property to `article-theme`.
:linenos:
project:
  ...
site:
  template: article-theme
```

## Site Options

Site options allow you to configure a theme's behavior.[^opts]
These should be placed in the `site.options` in your `myst.yml`.
For example:

[^opts]: They are generally unique to the theme (and thus in a dedicated `site.options` key rather than a top-level option in `site`).

```{code-block} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
site:
  options:
    favicon: my-favicon.ico
    logo: my-site-logo.svg
```

Below is a table of options for each theme bundled with MyST.

```{myst:template} book-theme
:heading-depth: 3
```

```{myst:template} article-theme
:heading-depth: 3
```

### Site URL Options

By default, MyST URLs only contain the file name for each page; folder structure is respected in the table of contents but is not reflected in URLs. If you would like to maintain nested folder structure in the URLs, you may set the site option `folders` to `true`. This causes each folder in your MyST directory to become a path segment. For this feature to work correctly, your chosen theme must also support `folders` as an option. Both `book-theme` and `article-theme` bundled with MyST support this.

```{code-block} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 3
site:
  options:
    folders: true
```

### Page Options

Depending on the option, these can also be controlled in the frontmatter on each page under the `site` key.

```{code-block} yaml
:filename: my-page.md
---
...
site:
  hide_toc: true
---
```

## Other top-level site configuration

There are some other top-level site configuration options not documented here.
You can find them in the following two files.
