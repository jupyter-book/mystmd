description: The Table of Contents is the left-hand navigation for your site, it can be auto-generated or can be explicitly defined in `myst.yml`.

The Table of Contents defines the structure of your MyST project. 
It is defined in the `toc` attribute of [the project frontmatter](frontmatter.md#in-a-myst-yml-file).

To automatically add a `toc` section to your `myst.yml` file using filenames to define ordering, use the following command:

```shell
myst init --write-toc
```

:::{seealso} Website exports
For website exports, the Table of Contents defines the left-hand navigation for your site.
See [](./website-navigation.md) for more information.

## Structure the Table of Contents

The MyST TOC comprises a simple tree structure, built from `file`s, `url`s, `pattern`s, and `children`. For example, a simple TOC consisting of files:

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml

version: 1
project:
  toc:
    - file: root.md
    - file: first-child.md
    - file: second-child.md
```

### URL entries

URLs can be defined in the TOC. These URLs are links to external references within your table of contents. URLs are ignored in non-web exports.

:::{warning} Work in progress
Currently these URLs are also ignored in MyST sites.
Follow https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1445 for this enhancement and please provide feedback.
:::

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml

version: 1
project:
  toc:
    - file: root.md
    - url: 'https://google.com'
```

### Glob pattern matching

You can specify glob-like patterns in the TOC with the `pattern` key.
The files matched by `pattern` will be expanded using similar logic to the [implicit table of contents](#implicit-toc):

- Folder structure is maintained
- [Project exclude](#project-exclude) files are respected
- Index/readme files are sorted to come first
- Files that are listed explicitly in the TOC will be ignored by the pattern

For example, with a folder with `root.md`, `child9.md`, `child10.md`, the following two `toc` entries are equivalent:

:::::{grid} 1 2 2 2
::::{card} Pattern-matching

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
version: 1
project:
  toc:
    - file: root.md
    - pattern: '*.md'
```

::::
::::{card} No pattern-matching

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 5,6
version: 1
project:
  toc:
    - file: root.md
    - file: child9.md
    - file: child10.md
```

::::
:::::

### Nesting pages and dropdowns

For larger projects, you can group the content using the `children` key, which can be defined for both `url` and `file` entries:

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
version: 1
project:
  toc:
    - file: root.md
    - file: part-1.md
      children:
        - file: part-1-first-child.md
        - file: part-1-second-child.md
    - file: part-2.md
      children:
        - file: part-2-first-child.md
        - file: part-2-second-child.md
```

You can nest children under a `title` without specifying a parent `file`.
This will create a dropdown of pages in the Table of Contents.

```{code} yaml
:filename: myst.yml
version: 1
project:
  toc:
    - file: root.md
    - title: Part 1
      children:
        - file: part-1-first-child.md
        - file: part-1-second-child.md
    - title: Part 2
      children:
        - file: part-2-first-child.md
        - file: part-2-second-child.md
```

(implicit-toc)=

## Implicit Table of Contents from filenames

When there is no `toc` field defined in your root `myst.yml`, the TOC is defined by the file system structure. All markdown and notebook files will be found in the working directory and all sub-directories. Filenames are not treated as case sensitive, and files are listed before folders. All hidden directories are ignored (e.g. `.git`) and the `_build` directory is also ignored.

The ordering of the table of contents will sort alphabetically as well as order by number, ensuring that, for example, `chapter10` comes after `chapter9`.

### Filename Transformations

The filenames will also be transformed into url-friendly “slugs” that: remove preceding numbers (unless they are year-like, e.g. 1988-02 or 2022); rename any non-url characters (spaces, underscores, etc.) to `-`; lowercase the filename; remove any file extensions (e.g. `.md` or `.ipynb`); and keep the slug less than 50 characters. If there are duplicates, these will be enumerated with a trailing number (e.g. `readme-1`).

- `01-notebook.ipynb` will become `notebook`
- `2021_02_presentation.md` will remain `2021-02-presentation`

### Title Transformations

If a title is not provided by a notebook or markdown document in the front matter or first heading, the filename is used. The filename is transformed to a title by splitting on camel case, replacing `-` or `_` with spaces, and transforming to title-case.

- `01_MyNotebook.ipynb` becomes `My Notebook`
- `my_article.md` becomes `My Article`

### Root Page

The “root” of a site is the page displayed when someone browses to the index of your site without any pathname. The CLI will choose the root file in the following order:

1. `index.md` / `README.md` / `main.md`
2. `index.tex` / `README.tex` / `main.tex`
3. `index.ipynb` / `README.ipynb` / `main.ipynb`
4. The first `.md` file found alphabetically
5. The first `.tex` file found alphabetically
6. The first `.ipynb` file found alphabetically

(project-exclude)=

### Excluding Files

If there are markdown or notebook files within a project folder that you do not want included in your project, you may list these in the `myst.yml` project frontmatter under `exclude`. For example, to ignore a single file `notes.md`, all notebooks in the folder `hpc/`, and all files named `ignore.md`:

```yaml
project:
  exclude:
    - notes.md
    - hpc/*.ipynb
    - '**/ignore.md'
```

Additionally, files excluded in this way will also not be watched during `myst start`. This may be useful if you have a folder with many thousands of files that causes the `myst start` watch task to crash. For example, in the `data/` directory, there may be no markdown and no notebooks but 100,000 small data files:

```yaml
project:
  exclude: data/**
```

Note that when these files are excluded, they can still be specifically referenced by other files in your project (e.g. in an {myst:directive}`include directives <include>` or as a download), however, a change in those files will not trigger a build. An alternative in this case is to generate a table of contents (see [](./table-of-contents.md)). By default hidden folders (those starting with `.`, like `.git`), `_build` and `node_modules` are excluded.

## Folder structure and URL slugs

By default, MyST will _flatten folder structure_ when creating URLs.
If a file is nested under a folder within your MyST project, for web-based exports its URL will be flattened to have a "slug" that removes folder information.
For example, a folder structure like:

- `folder1/folder2/my-article.md`

Produces this URL path:

- `/my-article`

Internal links will automatically be updated (duplicate filenames will have numbers appended, like `myfile-1`), and the `file` property in the [MyST document metadata](./website-metadata.md) will contain the original file path for the page.

### Make your URL match your folder structure

To make your URL match your folder structure (so that `myfolder/myfile.md` becomes `myfolder/myfile/`), set `site.options.folders` to `true` in `myst.yml`. For example:

```{code} yml
:filename: myst.yml
:caption: Example of setting folders to true to show nested file structure in the URL
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 78
:emphasize-lines: 82
...
site:
  template: book-theme
  options:
    folders: true
...
```

This will make a file like `folder1/folder2/01_my_article.md` render as the following URL slog: `/folder1/folder2/my-article`.

## Defining a `_toc.yml` using Jupyter Book v1 format

:::{warning}
Support for `_toc.yml` exists only for compatibility reasons, and will be removed in future.
New users should use `myst.yml` instead.
:::

Jupyter Book v2 uses the MyST engine, but Jupyter Book v1 uses a different configuration structure that is designed for Sphinx. However, you can currently use a Juypter Book v1 Table of Contents file (`_toc.yml`) with MyST.The documentation for this format is fully described in [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/structure/toc.html).
