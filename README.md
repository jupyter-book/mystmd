`mystmd` is a set of open-source, community-driven tools designed for scientific communication, including a powerful authoring framework that supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, reports and journals articles.

## Overview

The `mystmd` project provides a command line tool (`mystmd`) for working with MyST Markdown projects.

- Provides functionality for cross-referencing, external structured links, and scientific citations
- Translate and render MyST Markdown into:
  - HTML for static websites, and modern React for interactive websites (like this website!)
  - PDFs and LaTeX documents, with specific templates for over 400 journals
  - Microsoft Word export
- Parse MyST into a standardized AST, that follows the MyST Markdown Spec

See the [documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide).

## Get Started

Ensure that you have an updated version of Node installed (<https://nodejs.org/>):

```bash
node -v
>> v20.4.0
```

The MyST Markdown CLI is available through NPM, PyPI and Conda:

```bash
# Using npm, yarn, or pnpm
npm install -g mystmd
# Or using PyPI
pip install mystmd
# Or using Conda / Mamba
